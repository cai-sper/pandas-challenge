# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview
The PyCity Schools Analysis focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of 15 schools within a school district. The analysis considers various factors, including student math and reading scores, school budgets, spending per student, school type, and school size. The goal is to identify the highest-performing schools and understand the factors that contribute to student success.

## School Summary
- Detailed statistics for each of the 15 schools, including school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall.

## Math and Reading Scores by Grade
- Breakdown of average math and reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) for each school.

## Scores by School Spending
- Analysis of school performance based on per student budget. Schools are categorized into spending ranges, and statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each spending range.

## Scores by School Size
- Analysis of school performance based on school size. Schools are categorized into size ranges (small, medium, large), and statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each size category.

## Scores by School Type
- Analysis of school performance based on school type (charter or district). Statistics for average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % passing overall are provided for each school type.

## Conclusions
The PyCity Schools Analysis reveals several key findings:

1. **Spending per Student and Academic Performance**: There is a clear correlation between the amount spent per student and academic performance. Schools with lower per student spending tend to achieve higher scores and passing rates, while schools with higher per student spending have lower academic outcomes.

2. **Charter vs. District Schools**: Charter schools outperform district schools in multiple aspects. Charter schools have a significantly higher overall passing rate (90.4%) compared to district schools (53.7%). Additionally, charter schools have higher average math and reading scores.

3. **Top-Performing Schools**: The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools, which spend an average of $606.40 per student. In contrast, the bottom 5 schools are all district schools, spending an average of $646.60 per student. This reinforces the observation that lower per student spending is associated with better academic performance.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing student success within the PyCity school district. It emphasizes the importance of efficient resource allocation and the potential benefits of charter school models in achieving higher academic outcomes.
